# Key Takeaways from Lecture 1: Introduction to Digital Design & Computer Architecture

After attending the first lecture, here are the main points and some personal reflections:

## What the Course Is About
The course kicked off by laying out the big picture: we’ll be tracing the journey from the tiniest building blocks (transistors) all the way up to the complex processors that power everything from laptops to AI accelerators. The professor emphasized that we’ll not only learn the basics—like how transistors act as switches and how logic gates work—but also dive into how these pieces come together in real CPUs, GPUs, and even specialized hardware for machine learning.

## Why Computer Architecture Matters
One thing that stood out was the relevance of this field. The instructor made a strong case for why understanding computer architecture is crucial, especially with the explosion of new tech in AI, genomics, and cloud computing. It’s not just about building faster computers; it’s about making smart choices in both hardware and software design, and understanding the trade-offs involved.

## Trends in the Field
There’s a clear shift happening: we’re moving away from relying solely on general-purpose CPUs. Instead, there’s a big push toward heterogeneous computing—using GPUs, TPUs, and other accelerators tailored for specific tasks. Energy efficiency and performance are now the main bottlenecks, and there’s a growing need for domain-specific architectures (think: custom chips for AI or genomics).

## Key Concepts Introduced
- The “transformation hierarchy”: how a problem gets translated from an idea, to an algorithm, to software, to hardware, and finally down to electrons.
- The importance of the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) as the bridge between software and hardware.
- A quick intro to CMOS logic: how NMOS and PMOS transistors work as switches, and how they’re combined to make logic gates (we even looked at a CMOS inverter).

## Co-Design Philosophy
A recurring theme was the idea of co-design—optimizing both algorithms and hardware together, rather than in isolation. The professor gave examples from industry (like Google’s TPU and Tesla’s Dojo) to show how this approach can lead to huge improvements.

## Study Resources
We’ll mainly use two textbooks: Harris & Harris, and Patt & Patel. There are also extra materials for topics like binary numbers, and all lectures are recorded and available online (including problem-solving sessions).

## Final Thoughts
The instructor wrapped up by encouraging us to focus on truly understanding the material, not just passing exams. The goal is to develop the kind of deep knowledge and critical thinking that can help shape the future of computing.
